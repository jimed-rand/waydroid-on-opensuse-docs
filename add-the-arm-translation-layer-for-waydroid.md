# Add the ARM translation layer for Waydroid

In default, Waydroid only recognize the apps which support on CPU architecture you've use. For example, if you only have running Waydroid on `x86_64`, it will only support Android apps within `x86_64` only. Sometimes, it limits user's abilities to install some popular Android apps on Google Play (for GAPPS users). To extend the limit, you need to add the ARM translation layer which gave you the translation layer for running some Android apps with extended ABIs. It gives you abilities to make it experience nearly same with your tablet or smartphone.
